> Codes and final report materials for a research internship on IT-OT classification from packet capture (PCAP) files.

Specific objectives of the internship:
1. PCAP files often include data, which given a large volume of, can prove to be a suitable learning base for ML-based prediction. The primary objective was to create a pipeline for scanning PCAP files, extract useful features for classification and train appropriate ML models.
   
2. **Passive** IT-OT device classification is crucial to network survey and detection. We investigated and implemented research approaches for novel classification techniques, utilising NLP and regresssion methods.
   
3. Create a **scoring system** for accuracy of IT-OT classification models.
   
4. Develop algorithms for classification of network devices into *Purdue* and *OSI* layers.
   
5. Using device MAC addresses, create a vendor-MAC database which will allow recognition of vendor from MAC. A custom database was created, owing to unavailability of open source datasets.
